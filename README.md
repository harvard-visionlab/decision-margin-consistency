# Analysis code from "Quantifying agreement between humans and machines (or any model) using performance-concordance to overcome internal noise in humans"

Humans are noisy decision makers - given exactly the same stimulus and task, they don't always make the same decisions. Consequently, trial-by-trial analysis of human decisions will yield low error-consistency scores even when comparing a person to themselves! Performance-concordance is an analysis method for measuring agreement between two decision making systems (e.g., humans vs. deep neural network models), assessing whether those systems have a tendency to make errors on the same inputs, while aggregating across stimulus repetitions or observers to cancel out internal noise and isolate stimulus-level agreement. The paper is available on [arXiv]().
